# odin-landing-page

This is my second project for The Odin Project. In this project, I will
make a dummy landing page. I will practice

1. How to make a page from scratch, given a template.
2. How to use basic css.
3. How to use flexbox effectively.

Post Project Reflection:

After completing the project, I now feel more confident working with
flexbox. Some things that I think are of note:

1. I think it's good practice to declare 0 margin and padding for all
elements early on, so that they don't interfere with spacing later.
2. Add round corners by using border-radius: _px;
3. Use font-style to make text italic.

I had trouble getting the spacing to be just right, because of the
how the cascade interacts. Also, I felt like I had to do all of the
spacing manually to make it look good. It was especially weird to 
add padding to each individual section, as it felt like flexbox was
not cooperating in that regard.
